## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone
To clone this repository, run the following command :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirmit27/pms-backend.git
```

### 2. Environment
Now, to setup the virtual environment (**recommended**) for running this microsevice locally, follow these steps :

#### 1. Initialise the virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv name-of-your-choice
```

#### 2. Install the required libraries as mentioned in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Development
To start the **development** server, run the following command in the terminal :

- As you make changes to the **Python scripts**, the server will automatically restart the application to reflect those changes, courtesy of the **`--reload`** flag appended to the command.

### 4. Deployment
Follow the official documentation provided by **[Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-fastapi)** for deployment as a web service.
